      <span class="emoji-title">🏠 Home / Introduction</span>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Leo Liu — an international secondary school student in Canada who is passionate about biology, music, and the strange but beautiful creatures that share our world. I love discovering how life works, whether under a microscope, in a forest, or inside a jar full of spiders.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <span class="emoji-title">🧬 About Me</span>
      <p>
        Science and art shape how I see the world. I study biology because I want to understand life — from evolution and genetics to the mysteries of extinct species. I study music because it makes me relax and happy. I play piano and violin, and I believe that both science and music demand patience and imagination.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <span class="emoji-title">🕷️ My Spider World</span>
      <p>
        I raise and observe spiders — mainly false widow spiders, along with a few jumping spiders and long-legged cellar spiders. Watching how they hunt, build webs, and interact teaches me more about behavior and survival than any textbook. I record their life cycles and name each generation. Some of them have become part of my daily life!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <span class="emoji-title">🎹 Music & Creativity</span>
      <p>
        Music keeps me grounded and curious. I’ve played Beethoven’s sonatas, Bach’s preludes, and I sometimes arrange symphonic melodies for violin or piano.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <span class="emoji-title">🦖 Paleontology & Science</span>
      <p>
        Fossils and evolution fascinate me. I often imagine how dinosaurs lived, how species adapted, and how extinction shaped the planet we live on. My goal is to study paleobiology — a bridge between biology and earth history — to understand how life keeps reinventing itself.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <span class="emoji-title">💭 Philosophy</span>
      <p>
        I believe curiosity is the purest form of intelligence. Whether it’s decoding a spider’s instinct or a symphony’s structure, I want to keep asking “why” — and never stop learning.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <span class="emoji-title">🪨 Fossils, Rocks, and Crystals</span>
      <p>
        I collect and classify fossils, rocks, and crystals as part of my study of Earth and life sciences. Each specimen is labeled with its origin, geological period, and composition. Fossils provide direct evidence of evolution and species diversity through time. Rocks and minerals reveal information about Earth’s structure, temperature, and chemical processes. Together, they help me understand how biological and geological systems interact across millions of years.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <span class="emoji-title">🪶 Indigenous Culture and Communities</span>
      <p>
        I care deeply about Indigenous cultures and communities. I enjoy learning about their history, traditions, and ways of living that stay closely connected to nature. Whenever possible, I visit Indigenous communities to better understand their current living conditions and the challenges they face. I hope to contribute in meaningful ways — by supporting cultural preservation, education, and respect for traditional knowledge.
